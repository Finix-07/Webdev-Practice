        <pre>
            I used to rule the world
            Seas would rise when I gave the word
            Now in the morning, I sleep alone
            Sweep the streets I used to own

            I used to roll the dice
            Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
            Listen as the crowd would sing
            Now the old king is dead, long live the king
            One minute, I held the key
            Next the walls were closed on me
            And I discovered that my castles stand
            Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

            I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
            Roman Cavalry choirs are singin'
            Be my mirror, my sword and shield
            My missionaries in a foreign field
            For some reason, I can't explain
            Once you'd gone, there was never, never an honest word
            And that was when I ruled the world

            It was a wicked and wild wind
            Blew down the doors to let me in
            Shattered windows and the sound of drums
            People couldn't believe what I'd become
            Revolutionaries wait
            For my head on a silver plate
            Just a puppet on a lonely string
            Aw, who would ever wanna be king?

            I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
            Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
            Be my mirror, my sword and shield
            My missionaries in a foreign field
            For some reason, I can't explain
            I know Saint Peter won't call my name
            Never an honest word
            But that was when I ruled the world

            Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
            Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
            Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
            Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
            Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

            I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
            Roman Cavalry choirs are singin'
            Be my mirror, my sword and shield
            My missionaries in a foreign field
            For some reason I can't explain
            I know Saint Peter won't call my name
            Never an honest word
            But that was when I ruled the world</pre>
